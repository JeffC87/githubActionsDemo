# Github Actions Demo

## Description

My motivation for this project was to learn and experience the continous deployment and test cycle with github actions and render.  Why did I build this project?  To expand my full stack skills and learn the technologies that are available to assist with web development.  The problems that it solves, is exposure to github actions and setting them up for the testing of the app.  I learned that some of the testing cycles can be tedious but serve a great benefit for the development cycle.
